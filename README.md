Pay Me
=======

This is an example payment form handling app, it uses vanilla JS with
client side validation, an Express based backend and Jade for templating
HTML.

## Installation

First, you need to have Node.js installed.

If you don't you should:

```
brew install node
```

Don't have [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/), install it!

```
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

If you use Windows, point your browser (or Powershell) at:

```
https://nodejs.org/dist/v5.9.1/node-v5.9.1-x86.msi
```

You may also be able to use NuGet.


Now, clone the repository.

Once you have it downloaded, move into that directory and install all of
the dependencies with:

```
npm install
```
